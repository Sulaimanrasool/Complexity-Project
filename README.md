The .zip file initially contains the following items:

1) 'oslo_model.py' - python file:
  This contains the code of the Oslo Model, which was then used to research the properties of self-organised criticality. 
 
2) '01519545-ComplexityReport.pdf' - PDF file
   This contains the project report, highlighitng the research work.
